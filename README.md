# Swaad üçõ

**Swaad** is a simple and efficient food ordering platform inspired by Swiggy.  
It allows users to browse restaurants, view menus, explore food options and adding items to cart ‚Äî with real-time Swiggy API integration using a custom-built proxy server to avoid CORS issues.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Browse a variety of restaurants and menus
- Search funtionality  to search restaurants
- Live data fetched from Swiggy's public APIs
- Smooth and responsive frontend experience
- Simple and clean UI for easy navigation
- Redux Toolkit - Efficient state management and seamless Add to Cart functionality with the Redux Toolkit library
- CORS-free integration using a Serverless proxy

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux, TailwindCSS, Parcel (bundler)
- **Backend Proxy:** Node.js Serverless function (`api/proxy.js`) {Not have deep knowledge of this till now,just done that to solve CORS issue}
- **Hosting:** Vercel 

---

##  How It Works

- The frontend sends a request to `/api/proxy?url=<Swiggy_API_URL>`.
- The proxy server (`api/proxy.js`) fetches data from Swiggy‚Äôs API while bypassing CORS restrictions.
- The proxy server forwards the data back to the frontend safely.
- The frontend displays live restaurant and menu data.

‚úÖ This architecture completely avoids browser CORS errors while fetching from external APIs!
